    "# MolDiff: Complete 3D Molecular Generation Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a complete implementation of MolDiff - a diffusion model for 3D molecular generation that addresses the atom-bond inconsistency problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Improvements Over Basic Implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Joint Atom-Bond Modeling**: Explicit bond prediction alongside atoms and positions\n",
    "2. **Categorical Diffusion**: Proper handling of discrete features (atom types, bond types)\n",
    "3. **Bond-Aware Message Passing**: GNN that considers both atoms and bonds\n",
    "4. **Chemical Validity**: Constraints and guidance for realistic molecules\n",
    "5. **Different Noise Schedules**: Bonds diffuse faster than atoms (key MolDiff insight)\n",
